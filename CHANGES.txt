1.2.1

- set the VisibleToAllUsers flag on all jobflows
- update to version 1.3.24 of the Amazon SDK for Java

1.2.0

- s3/cp now supports S3 directory to S3 directory copies

- Support in defcluster for two Amazon features
  - set the hadoop-version with :hadoop-version which takes a string like "0.20.205"
  - set supported-products with :supported-products, e.g.
    (defcluster ...
      :supported-products ["karmasphere-enterprise-utility"])

- In defstep, a value of "nil" should be converted to nil.  This captures the common case
  of :args.foo "${foo}" when :foo is unset.

- New helper function lemur.core/eoval - use this in your defstep args to get the value
  of an option.
  E.g. (defstep ...
          :args.foo (eoval foo))
  This is better than "${foo}" in that it will return the value of :foo without converting
  it into a string.  This is most important for Boolean values, i.e. you want the value true,
  not the string "true".

- Catch this common error and handle it as most people would expect:
  (defstep ...
    :args.foo "${foo}")
  With no entry in (catch-args).  Previously this resulted in a stackoverflow, as it repeatedly
  repeatedly called itself to get the value of "${foo}".  Now, the (catch-args) entry is
  created implicitly with a default of nil.

- bugfix: When there is an explicit catch-args for a boolean option:
    E.g. (catch-args [:foo? "some help"] false)
  defstep would not recognize it, and would instead create a new option, non-boolean option :foo.
  Now, you can create boolean options like this, which work with the catch-args example above:
  (defstep ...
    :args.foo (eoval :foo?))

- fix bootstrap-actions-test/mk-hadoop-config unit test

1.1.1

- Bugfix: :ami-version default should only be set in base.clj, not the command line defaults,
  otherwise it is not over-ridable in a project specific base file.
