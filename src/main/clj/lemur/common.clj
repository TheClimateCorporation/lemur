(defn val-opts
  "Creates a validator function, which validates named options in eopts.

    (val-opts options+ [keyword-name*] err-msg?)

  options is one or more of:

    :required - this option is required
    :numeric - the option, if it exists, must be numeric (float or int)
    :word - the option, if it exists, must contain only word characters (alpha-numeric, _, -)
    :file - the option, if it exists, must be an existing file (local or S3)
    :dir - the option, if it exists, must be an existing dir (local or S3)
    :file-or-dir - the option, if it exists, must be an existing file/dir (local or S3)
    :local-dir - the option, if it exists, must be an existing local directory

  A single keyword-name, or a collection of keyword-names follows the options.
  These are the keywords in eopts that you want to validate.

  err-msg is an optional String with a custom error message to report on failure.
  If err-msg is not given, than a suitable message is constructed based on the
  check that failed.

  Examples:

    ; The :keypair option is required. In all cases, :required can be satisified
    ; either by an entry in the jobdef or with a --option on the command-line
    (val-opts :required [:keypair])

    ; :scripts-src-path is required, and must be an existing file/directory
    (val-opts :dir :required [:scripts-src-path])

    ; :some-optional-path is NOT required, but if specified, it must be
    ; an existing file/directory
    (val-opts :file-or-dir [:some-optional-path])

    ; Both :app and :foo are required, and must contain only word-characters
    (val-opts :required :word [:app :foo])"

    :min N - should contain at least N entries

    :required coll - the collection lists required options in --opt form (requires

    :mini-spec - A mini command spec, which, if it exists, is applied before the
    checks above, so that those checks are only validating what is 'left-over'.
    It's value is a collection of keywords naming options that are understood by
