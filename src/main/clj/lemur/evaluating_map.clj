  For strings, interpolate variables in the string. For collections, evaluate (recursively)
  each entry in the collection. In the function case, the result of the function is again
  evaluated, other types are returned as is.

  Also see core/lfn for a convenient helper macro for creating these functions.

  The optional argument unused-steps, is a coll of maps (presumably created by defstep). If
  the key can not be found in m, but is found in one of the maps in unused-steps, then
  output a warning. A common mistake is to define a value in defstep, when it needs to be in
  defcluster."
